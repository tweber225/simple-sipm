# simple-sipm

Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPM), also called Mulit-Pixel Photon Counters by Hamamatsu, are a game-changing technology for high-sensitivity photon detection. They stand to replace older, vacuum tubed-base photomultipliers in applications such as laser scanning micrscopy. You can find plenty of information about the virtues of these devices many places on the internet.

Here, I am posting a quick and simple circuit to house a Hamamatsu S14420-series SiPM with onboard transimpedance amplification.
